In today's digital age, selling online has become more important than ever. This is due to several reasons, ranging from the desire to reach a wider audience, to the world having gone mostly digital and also the need to have other sources of income or side hustle especially now that the lady in red lingerie aka "Aunty Susu" (in Prof's voice) has decided to pay a visit, you might want to consider selling power bank in ATL Marketplace.

Although selling in an online marketplace can be tricky and overwhelming, it can also be rewarding but let's learn from someone who's just embarked on this adventure? 

So, In this article, we'll hear from a new vendor (Olushola) in the ATL online marketplace who's navigating this exciting journey and discover the key lessons she has learnt along the way.

 

Tina â€“ What product do you sell on the ATL online marketplace and how did you come up with that product idea

Olushola â€“ I sell honey, original wild honey in the ATL online marketplace. I think honey is an essential part of life, everyone should have a bottle in the their house â€“ like the bible. It's not just for consumption but also for your skincare, haircare and a lot of other things.

Tina â€“ Most times, buyers are looking out for the best deals and quality products especially online, how best do you think they can go about it and what makes your product (honey) stand out compared to others in the online marketplace?

Olushola â€“ One thing to look out for when buying products on any online marketplace is reviews (not influencer reviews though). 

What do people have to say about a particular product? Follow the person or vendor for a while and observe their posts as well.

I'm not sure if there are other vendors who sell honey but for my honey, I'm trying to implement strips for tests. such that if you buy from me, you can use the strip to check if it suits your preference. That way you don't have to open the main bottle and it can be returned for refund if it's not what you want.

Tina â€“ That would be amazing, I'm certain people would love that. Shola, how can we identify original honey?

Olushola â€“ Lots of people mention different tests online to identify quality honey but most are not true because honey is gotten from whatever bees feed on so it differs from place to place and from terrain. But some things are constant about honey that no matter what the bees feed on or their location it's the same for example honey does not attract sugar ants. If it does then it has been adulterated, another one is its consistency. Honey does not easily mix with water (how fast it mixes is dependent on how much water content it already has). Number 3 â€“ Honey does not go bad. If it does, then it means something has been mixed with it. It can stay for years without going bad, if you store your honey and it goes bad it means something was added to it.

Tina â€“ You mentioned storage, how do you store honey, at room temperature or you refrigerate it?

Olushola â€“ If you refrigerate it, it will crystalize and that's not something you really want with your honey. It's not that crystallisation is bad, it's even a sign that it's original. But I just store it at room temperature off the ground, on top of a shelf. 

Tina â€“ I'm sure you've encountered some challenges despite being new in the ATL online marketplace space. Can you share a major challenge? 

Olushola â€“ I think people who majorly visit the ATL online marketplace are those who post their business and not those looking for what to get/buy. I may be wrong, I stand to be corrected, but I feel there's no response. 

So looking at ATL at large, I don't think the average person here will say "oh i need honey" then decide to check the ATL marketplace to get from a vendor there. I think that's a challenge. Pushing the ATL online marketplace to people that you can get things from the online marketplace and getting it here is supporting and encouraging others in the community

Tina â€“ I agree with you, but how are you handling this challenge so far?

Olushola â€“ It's really tough, but it's just what it is. I don't feel anxious or frustrated although I'm banking on this interview. I hope people will do things differently after this interview. So lets see what it will do for people in ATLðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚

Tina â€“ ðŸ™‚ I hope for positive feedback as well. So, Shola, to wrap our interview up, what's one piece of advice you'd give to someone who's thinking of joining the online marketplace?

Olushola â€“ Consistency. I think that's the word â€“ Consistency. And this goes beyond ATL marketplace to all other online marketplace. If you're continuously talking about your product even though people might not engage or acknowledge it, they know you're the honey guy because they've seen it too many times that it's saved in their heads already . So one day when someone casually mentions honey to them, they'll go like "ohhh i know a guy who sells honey" and when you least expect it you find out that you're making sales. So, it's basically putting it in their faces.

Tina â€“ Thank you very much Shola, it's been a wonderful time with you.

 

Certainly! Here's a fitting conclusion for your article:
