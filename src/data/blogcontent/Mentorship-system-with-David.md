“The day a man stops learning is the day he starts dying” is a common saying. More importantly, the dynamic world of finance requires continuous learning and proper mentorship. 

Imagine having a mentor who encourages ongoing education and adaptation to market trends, ensuring you remain agile and informed. Isn’t that a luxury? 

So, we took an impactful tour with one of our great mentors in ATL and had him share his experiences in this regard. 

In this article, we feature Mr David Adesanya, the leader of ATL Mentorship System to take us on an educative ride to the world of mentorship. Enjoy! 

Omowumi Esther: Can we meet you sir? 

David Adesanya: I’m David. I joined ATL about 4 years ago, June 18 2020 precisely. I like football (I’m a massive Arsenal fan), philosophy, and general techy stuff.

Omowumi Esther: Nice intro up there! So, can you share with us, what’s your biggest motivation for becoming a mentor in ATL and what does being a mentor mean to you?

David Adesanya: I think it’s about giving a part of me back to where I have been blessed. I’ve been blessed through the community, and I believe I am responsible for paying it forward for as long as possible.

Omowumi Esther: Hmmm… That’s thoughtful of you, sir. 

David Adesanya: Thankfully, I have a team that helps a lot. There’s a certain balance of emotional intelligence needed to handle multiple facets of the system, though. I constantly have to balance getting things done and not coming off as insensitive or too assertive. It’s essential to keep all active parties motivated.

Omowumi Esther: I picked that part of emotional intelligence and teamwork. It’s genuinely essential in mentorship. I love that. Can you briefly describe a few successful mentoring experiences you’ve had? How were you able to achieve them?

David Adesanya: Well, I’ve been able to guide a couple of people from quitting to achieving their goals. It often starts from them opening up or me spotting some patterns when auditing their reports. To be honest, I can’t really say “I” achieved. They put 90% of the work. Most times, motivation is what people need. I find how I can do that consistently and put them in environments that will challenge them.

Omowumi Esther: Learning powerful strategies here about “motivation”. What you shared now actually made me reflect on the times I took certain uneasy steps to achieve some set goals and I discovered motivation was my major drive. Mentorship is sensitive really. Thank you for addressing that. So can you share with us, how do you customize mentorship for different people? Everyone is unique, so “one-size-fits-all” strategies don’t always work. Sometimes, you have to meet folks where they are to really help them. What are your tips and tricks for doing this? 

David Adesanya: So I view mentorship in a very specific way. It starts out with someone wanting to be guided through a path already taken by another person. It should make the journey easier.Unless in very specific situations, I don’t sort mentor/mentee pairings based on a particular type of fit.  That said, my strategy starts from ensuring that the mentors are chosen to fit certain requirements – as people, traders and members of the community.  From there, the mentees are encouraged to pursue a relationship with the mentors beyond the surface level. The mentor is already invested in your growth, but I encourage a level of openness that will give the mentor a 360 degree view over the aspect they’re mentoring.  My team monitors all official interactions and when changes are needed at either level, we act.

Omowumi Esther: Hmmm… Nice approach! Here’s a two-part question for you. First, how do you build trust with your mentees so they feel comfortable sharing their struggles, especially those going through tough times? People are complicated, and insecurity can make some folks stay in their shells. For example, some are super introverted and find it really hard to connect. As a mentor, how do you help them open up and improve?

David Adesanya: Personally, I ensure I actively check in with my mentees. Not just online. I call. We discuss aspects of their lives that they might struggle with or need advice on. I realize it could be some external factors that cause issues in trading, so it’s key for me to try to unblock those areas.  They call me anytime too. We’ve developed that closeness and they’re free with me to a reasonable extent.   That’s a personal thing. Could be different for another mentor. 

Omowumi Esther: Hmmm… Very true.  

David Adesanya: At the start of the journey, I make sure I explain that, although I understand that we’re different (I’m introverted myself), it’s important to prioritize growth and do the right things needed. It’s one of the reasons I try to get a bit personal with calls. That’s my way of helping them take the leap. 

Omowumi Esther: Wow. Quite a thoughtful approach. On a related note, can you tell me about a time you had to give tough feedback to a mentee? How did you handle it?

David Adesanya: I say what has to be said. I just try to measure my words and offer potential solutions in addition to the criticism.  

Omowumi Esther: Great job balancing assertiveness and empathy! Now, let’s talk about your growth as a mentor. How do you stay up-to-date in your field to give your mentees the best advice?

David Adesanya: I think being up to date about things happening is important in mentorship. I try to note the potential risks of things happening before they even come to me. Also I try to share whatever updates I think are relevant to their current level, whether for profit or to reduce risk. 

Omowumi Esther: Hmmm… Kudos! So, what key qualities do you think a mentor needs for a successful mentoring experience?  

David Adesanya: My top 4 are: Empathy, Discipline, Availability, Knowledge.

Omowumi Esther: Thank you for sharing these insights with us. The last but not the least question for now, What do you hope to learn or gain from being a mentor? And can you share some helpful tips for current and future mentors?

David Adesanya: I honestly just want to give and give some more. I guess that’s my gain.   For mentors and aspiring mentors, John Crosby once said

“Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction.”  

If you can be these things, people will be blessed through you.  

Omowumi Esther: Wow, this interview on mentorship has been amazing! Thanks so much for joining me. I’ve learned a ton from this interview, and I’m sure everyone else has too. I can’t wait to do more of these with you. Thanks for sharing your wisdom!

David Adesanya: Thank you for the time too. It was a fun session. 

In a nutshell, mentorship is all about guiding, supporting, and inspiring others to reach their full potential. It’s a journey of mutual growth where both mentor and mentee learn and evolve together. 

Remember, the essence of mentorship lies in its ability to transform lives, build confidence, and create lasting connections. Whether you’re a seasoned mentor or just starting out, keep nurturing those relationships and watch the magic happen. Happy mentoring!
